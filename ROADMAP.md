# Roadmap

## Top-level goals

* Extensibility: custom components, shaders
* Performance: raycasting (three.js), head tracking on mobile (webvr-polyfill), anything DOM/Custom Elements-related
* Ecosystem: enable discovery and distribution of assets, components, scenes, snippets, shaders

## `0.2.0`

* Merge aframe-core repo into aframe repo
* Custom shaders
* New primitives implementation (extending entities instead of templates of grouped elements)
* Video playback issues (on Android, iOS)
* Improved mobile experience (orientation lock, initial position, etc.)
* Systems (shared logic of components)
* Texture caching
* Improved asset management and loading
* obj model support

## Future

* glTF support
